I am Padraic Doyle.  I am a location independent, part-time digital nomad, part-time philosopher, brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt, minimalist, on a never ending pursuit of freedom.  Well, I try to be these things at least!

**I am currently living in Upstate NY working as the CTO of TableUp and Cofounder of Inspect Point.**

####My Startup Rock Bottom (or the catalyst)

A few years ago Jennifer and I tried, and failed, to launch what I would consider a "traditional vc style" startup.  After dumping a lot of time and money down the drain I not only realized the business was going nowhere...but I realized that none of it was making me happy.  Even the successful outcome wasn't what either of us wanted.

###Moment of Clarity

At the time I was co-owner of an old duplex in Troy, NY.  I was taking a bath (I do my best thinking and reading in the bath) when I realized that we* had to shut down the start up, take a step back, figure out exactly what we wanted, and work backwards from there.

\* when I saw we I am referring to Jennifer Harris and myself.

###What did we want?
This is constantly changing, but we realized that we both wanted the same thing.  We wanted to be free.

###You were born in the USA...aren't you already free
Yes, but there are levels to freedom.  On top of that I firmly believe that traditional life scripts that we are taught from an early age
