I am Padraic Doyle.  I am a location independent, part-time digital nomad, part-time philosopher, brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt, minimalist, on a never ending pursuit of freedom.  Well, I try to be these things at least!

**I am currently living in Upstate NY with the beautiful, intelligent, and strong Jennifer Harris.  I am currently working as the CTO of TableUp and Cofounder of Inspect Point.**

## Why "Conquer by Fortitude"?
**Fortiudine Vincit** - ***he conquers by fortitude*** is the Doyle Family motto.  I thought it would be a pretty cool name for a blog.

## What I am Working On
- [Inspect Point](http://www.inspectpoint.com/) - Fire protection inspection software
- [Two Penguins Studios](http://www.twopenguinsstudios.com) - Jennifer and I take on the occasional consulting project.

## What I am Interested In
- Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
- Tiny Houses
- AR and VR
- Hearthstone
