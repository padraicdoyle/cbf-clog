###The Startup Rock Bottom

A few years ago Jennifer and I tried, and failed, to launch what I would consider a "traditional vc style" startup.  After dumping a lot of time and money down the drain I not only realized the business was going nowhere...but I realized that none of it was making me happy.  Even the successful outcome wasn't what either of us wanted.

###Moment of Clarity

At the time I was co-owner of an old duplex in Troy, NY.  I was taking a bath (I do my best thinking and reading in the bath) when I realized that we* had to shut down the start up, take a step back, figure out exactly what we wanted, and work backwards from there.

\* when I saw we I am referring to Jennifer Harris and myself.

###What did we want?
We wanted to travel.  We wanted to be out of debt.  We wanted to work on interesting fulfilling projects.  We wanted to be free.

###What was stopping us?
