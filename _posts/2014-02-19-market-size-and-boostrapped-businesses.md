When evaluting ideas for my latest bootstrapped businesses I started with the framework outlined in Jason Cohen's talk from last year microconf. In particular the goal of

The biggest takeaway I had from last years Microconf was Jason Cohen's talk on
At last year's MicroConf Jason Cohen's talk included a section on what makes a product/idea a good fit for a bootstrappped.

Why? Two reasons.

- It made me wake up and stop worrying about silly things like scale, growth hacking, and fly wheels (a post for the future).  When you are under 50 customers selling boostrapped SASS products require actual sales skills (cold emailing, cold calling, taking to customers, etc...).  I had to be prepared to scratch and crawl to my first 100 customers.

- I started to frame my SAAS ideas with the premise that I was building a business with the goal of $10,000 of *net profit, per month, per partner*.


How does this change things?

Mainly with idea and market selection.  I need to find a pain point, solve problems, and provide value - but I needed to do this in market where bootsrapped teams have a change to compete.


Whats so special about $10,000 of MRR?
-----
- $10,000 of reoccurring profit a month is a significant amount of additional money for most people.
- The market is too small for VC backed startups to play in but can handle several players.
- People responsible for the purchasing descisons can be reached easily by phone or email.

By starting with a specific revenue goal in mind, and working backwards from the goal, I started to really see the *difference between a VC backed product and a bootstrapped product*.

How certain markets needed to be avoided entirely. That *niching it down* was not just a way to reach a highly targeted market, but it was also a way to ensure that you werent playing in the same leauge as the big players (who need large returns on invested capital).


First Steps

Call customers.  If this does not sound appealing to you then you might be in the wrong space.  The drive traffic to landing page to email capture to sales funnel sounds appealing for a lot of developer entrepreneurs, but in I see this working less and less.
