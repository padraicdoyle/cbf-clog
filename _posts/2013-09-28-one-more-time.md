I have not kept a regular blog since 2004.  That blog, and many others, are long gone - DOA.  I have tried many times to start up again but for one reason or another it never stuck.  Why try again?

## Writing is a Skill
I believe writing is one of the most important skills one can have.  In order to "sharpen the saw" I need an outlet where I can write freely while practicing the skill.

##More Things to Say
My life has changed a lot in the past 10 yrs.  New knowledge, new experiences, new businesses, some successes, and a equal amount of failures gives me a little bit of "source material" to draw from.  If I learn something new I will try to write about it here.

##Jekyll, Markdown, and Github
Almost all of my businesses use Wordpress in some capacity.  I am very grateful for the amount of work the Wordpress community has put into the platform.  It has made all of our lives easier.  A day does not go by where I am not logged into a Wordpress admin area, and, because of that, I could not imagine doing that for a personal blog.  Not to mention Wordpress shared hosting sucks.

It is fun writing/publishing using jekyll, markdown, and github - I am motivated to learn more about the platform.

##Travel and Becoming a Digital Nomad
My girlfriend Jennifer, my little sister Katie, and myself have flights booked for Bali in Feb, 2014.  I want a place where people who know us can follow along on the trip.
