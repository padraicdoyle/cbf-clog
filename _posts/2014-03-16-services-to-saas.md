Thank You Notes to Mobile App Platform
----
Around two years ago my friend and occasional business partner Marc and I thought it would be a great idea to create a web app where customers could send hand written thank you notes to other people (we were both a few beers deep).  Who would write the thank you notes? *It didn't matter!* Lets just make the product and see what happens.  Did we talk to any potential customers? No.  Did we have any idea what we were doing?  Not really.  Would it succeed? Probably not.

We ended up creating a B2C web application without understanding the problem we were solving, not thinking about pricing, not knowing the customer acquisition channels - too many mistakes to list.  Notes were actually sold, but needles were not being moved. If anything it was a distraction to the other projects we were individually working on.  Our dreams of a hand written thank you note empire were not just dying - they were dead on arrival.  *At the end of the day we made every mistake in the book.*

Over more beers Marc and I talked about if we wanted to shut the site down or keep it up.  Marc's family owns a car dealership and he causally mentioned that they occasionally send thank you notes to customers as well as hand written reminders.  Maybe there was a B2B play we could explore?  I did not feel like writing another line of code, or changing the existing site at all, but the more we thought about it, we thought - *did we really need a site?*  Why don't we just call up some potential customers, give them the pitch about why hand written notes were great for branding and customer retention, quote them some prices, and see what happens.

So that is what we did - and it worked.  Businesses bought notes! We slowly started to figure out things:

* what was our value proposition? 
* what is the most we could actually charge?
* are there any other services we could potential offer?  

Businesses bought more notes.  *Businesses actually pay for things.*  We did not have a real website (the web app was still up), and we did not worry about things like scale.  All we did was talk to potential customers, hear what they needed, and tried to craft a product (really a productized service) to fit their needs.  Through our conversations we slowly moved away from hand written thank you notes and started to provide direct mailing solutions to car dealerships.  We learned and adapted.


Finding a More Painful Pain Point
---
Marc had a network of people in the car dealership industry.  *By leveraging his existing network we had a pool of people (including family members) who were willing to at least pick up the phone when we called.*  This was very important when we were starting out.  Through causal conversation with existing customers we started to learn the systems the car dealerships were using to store their inventory and customer data.  These systems (Dealer Management Systems or DMS) had APIs and partner programs, and there was an entire industry of SAAS products that interact with these systems.  

Through interviewing and casual conversation with car dealerships we realized that many of these dealerships wanted a native mobile app.  Customers were asking how to download the dealer's app in the app stores and they always had to explain to them that what they actually had was a mobile web app and they were not in the app store.  There web traffic and web leads were slowly decreasing. Some of the dealerships wished they could have more integration with their current backend systems then their websites currently provided.  I had some experience with the native vs web app argument with one of my other products [Zenpush](http://www.zenpush.com/) and started to mention native solutions to the various dealerships.

We saw an opportunity.  After talking to several of the DMS vendors we decided to integrate with one that had a decent install base and an easy to work with API.  Through our direct mail offering we had a good idea what the car dealerships were willing to pay for marketing products, what their monthly marketing budget was, what the competition was charging, and how much the automobile manufacturers would reimburse them for.  *Most importantly we had a list of existing service customers which we could pitch our potential SAAS product.*  

We would have known none of this if we just started building a product.  Only though talking to customers did we learn all the information that lead us to start coming up with requirements for next product offering.  However, even after learning all of this, we were still not ready to start building anything.


Pre-Selling our Non-Existing Product
---
Before we started building anything I made some mockups of our potential mobile app platform and recorded a screencast of some of the potential features we planned to build.  We then demoed this screencast to some potential customers.  It was important to us that we made it very clear that this was a platform/product offering and not custom development.  The features you see here would be the features we would be building. 

*Would you pay for this?*  Some said yes, others no, others maybe - but all of them gave feedback on why they would make the decision and we incorporated this feedback into future iterations of the demo.

*We iterated on the product before writing one line of code.*

Eventually three dealerships agreed to an annual contract and we were ready to start building.  Billing would start once the iOS app was submitted to the app store.  Features were agreed upon before development started, and we kept each dealership up to date with the development progress.  

The apps are now ready for app store submission and invoices are about to be sent out.

What We Learned
---
* Talk to customers early and often (while respecting their time).
* Leverage any existing network you may have.  If you can not talk to anyone in your potential market you may have to rethink the market.
* Do not worry all that much about driving traffic to landing pages.  We took 3 hrs to build a landing page and never really did anything with it.  Instead we used that time to find people to talk to us.
* Pick a target market where you can reach people with purchasing power over the phone or email.  Individually reach out to these people personally and do not worry about scale.
* If you do not mind sales or talking to people consider building a product with a higher price point.  Although this lengthens sales cycles it also lowers churn which leads to better revenue forecasting.

Where Do We Go From Here
---
* Our goal is fifteen customers by the end of the year.  We have a sales and marketing plan to get there.  It involves off line sales, educational marketing via webinars and demos, and cold emailing/calling.  Sales will be our first hire.  Marketing and sales scale is not a concern.  

* We are crafting services to upsell our current customers.  We have an idea of what these offerings will be and are talking to existing customers to flush out exactly what they will entail.

By talking to customers before we built the product we were able to actually build something that businesses wanted to pay for.  We hope to continue to evolve our services, marketing, sales, and features as we talk to more and more customers and prospects.
