I started back up at [Feral Crossfit](http://feral-crossfit.com/) yesterday and I thought it would be a good time to jot down some goals.  Quality of life for my Bali trip is top priority, and I am trying to pick performance goals with that mind.  Where before I would focus more on strength (mostly because I am decent at the power lifts) this time around I am focusing more on things like range of motion, quality of movement, and bodyweight to strength ratio.

In other words being able to comfortably run 3 miles is more important then a 500# deadlift, I will sacrifice a 300# bench press for more strict pullups, etc...


## Physical Goals in the Gym
- 400# Squat (We are starting a 6 week squat cycle so I need some type of squat goal)
- 5 strict pullups by end of 2013
- 5 handstand pushups by end of 2013

## Physical Goals out of the Gym
- 5k in under 30 mins at the [Saratoga First Night 5k Run](http://www.saratoga-arts.org/firstnight/5krun)

## The Way
The plan is to train at Feral Crossfit M/T/R/F in the mornings and do some easy running/walking at lunch.

Sitting at the my desk for 8-10 hrs a day is killing me so I am going to make a conscious effort to get up and move throughout the day by using our [Stop Sitting](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-sitting/id672490502?mt=8) app.
