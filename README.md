# Conquer by Fortitude...a blog!

I write software and launch boostrapped software based businesses (usually with services thrown in there).  This blog will mostly be about that (suprise!).  The theme I am using is [Balzaz for Jekyll](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) and the blog is hosted on Github.
